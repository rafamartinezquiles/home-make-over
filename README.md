# AI-Powered Interior Restyling: Automated Room Makeover Using Generative Computer Vision
Using advanced computer vision and generative AI models—including Stable Diffusion, Diffusers, PyTorch, and OpenCV—to transform interior room photographs into photorealistic restyled designs while preserving the original spatial layout.

## Overview and Background
Restyling an interior space traditionally requires professional design expertise, manual rendering, and time-consuming 3D workflows. Recent advances in generative computer vision, particularly Stable Diffusion’s image-to-image capabilities, enable realistic, high-quality visual transformations from a single photograph. By guiding the model with curated interior-design style prompts, it becomes possible to alter furniture, materials, colors, and ambiance while preserving the room’s original geometry and camera perspective.

This project leverages diffusion models, PyTorch, and custom prompt engineering to automatically generate magazine-quality room makeovers in a wide range of styles. Users upload a room photo, select a design direction, and the system produces a photorealistic transformation consistent with real-world textures and lighting. The goal is to demonstrate how generative AI can democratize interior design, enabling non-technical users to visualize professional-level makeovers instantly.
